                        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
                        <p>Our Mission at GWCFC is encapsulated in our four core values: 
                            KNOW GOD, FIND FREEDOM, DISCOVER PURPOSE, and MAKE A DIFFERENCE. 
                            We believe no one should journey through life alone or without a sense of purpose. 
                            Therefore, we prioritize creating opportunities for everyone to connect, 
                            uncover their purpose, 
                            feel a sense of belonging to a family, and deepen their relationships with God and one another.</p>
                        
                        <h2>Our Vision</h2>
                        <p>We envision a community where every person feels valued, loved, and empowered to live out their faith in meaningful ways. Our goal is to be a beacon of hope and healing in our neighborhood, offering support, guidance, and spiritual nourishment to all who seek it.</p>
                        
                        <h2>Our Values</h2>
                        <ul class="values-list">
                            <li><strong>Know God:</strong> More than practicing religion, God wants a real relationship with you.
                                Whether you’re new to faith, have questions, or have been a Christian for
                                a long time, we pray that you encounter God in our weekend services and
                                learn more about what it means to grow closer to Him.
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Find Freedom:</strong> God wants you to live in community with others. At GWCFC, we
                                intentionally pursue relationships through Small Groups. Groups gather
                                weekly for most of the year, and there are multiple chances to join. We’d
                                love for you to search our Online Directory to find a group that fits your
                                schedule, interests, and season of life.
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Discover Purpose:</strong>You’re an important part of God’s plan, and your life will make the most
                                sense when you discover His purpose for you. The GWCFC Growth Track
                                is designed to help you do that. We’d love for you to join us for this simple
                                three-step experience that you can conveniently attend a week at a time
                                on Sundays. All three steps of the Growth Track happen monthly, so listen
                                for more details about the Growth Track in the service today, or visit our
                                website to learn more.
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Make a Difference:</strong>God’s ultimate plan for you is to make an eternal difference in the lives of
                                others. Through the GWCFC Dream Team, our team of volunteers, we hope
                                to connect you to an opportunity to make a difference here at GWCFC by
                                using the gifts God has given you to strengthen the Body of Christ through
                                the church. You can take steps to join the team and use the gifts God has
                                given you to strengthen the Body of Christ by attending the Growth Track.
