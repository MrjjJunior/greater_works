                        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
                        <p>Our Mission at GWCFC is encapsulated in our four core values: 
                            KNOW GOD, FIND FREEDOM, DISCOVER PURPOSE, and MAKE A DIFFERENCE. 
                            We believe no one should journey through life alone or without a sense of purpose. 
                            Therefore, we prioritize creating opportunities for everyone to connect, 
                            uncover their purpose, 
                            feel a sense of belonging to a family, and deepen their relationships with God and one another.</p>
                        
                        <h2>Our Vision</h2>
                        <p>We envision a community where every person feels valued, loved, and empowered to live out their faith in meaningful ways. Our goal is to be a beacon of hope and healing in our neighborhood, offering support, guidance, and spiritual nourishment to all who seek it.</p>
                        
                        <h2>Our Values</h2>
                        <ul class="values-list">
                            <li><strong>Know God:</strong> More than practicing religion, God wants a real relationship with you.
Whether you’re new to faith, have questions, or have been a Christian for
a long time, we pray that you encounter God in our weekend services and
learn more about what it means to grow closer to Him.</li>
                            <li><strong>Find Freedom:</strong> God wants you to live in community with others. At GWCFC, we
intentionally pursue relationships through Small Groups. Groups gather
weekly for most of the year, and there are multiple chances to join. We’d
love for you to search our Online Directory to find a group that fits your
schedule, interests, and season of life.</li>
                            <li><strong>Discover Purpose:</strong>You’re an important part of God’s plan, and your life will make the most
sense when you discover His purpose for you. The GWCFC Growth Track
is designed to help you do that. We’d love for you to join us for this simple
three-step experience that you can conveniently attend a week at a time
on Sundays. All three steps of the Growth Track happen monthly, so listen
for more details about the Growth Track in the service today, or visit our
website to learn more.</li>
                            <li><strong>Make a Difference:</strong>God’s ultimate plan for you is to make an eternal difference in the lives of
others. Through the GWCFC Dream Team, our team of volunteers, we hope
to connect you to an opportunity to make a difference here at GWCFC by
using the gifts God has given you to strengthen the Body of Christ through
the church. You can take steps to join the team and use the gifts God has
given you to strengthen the Body of Christ by attending the Growth Track.</li>

                <div class="history-content">
                    <p>History of Greater Works Christian Family Church<br>

                        August 2015 – Small Beginnings
                        Greater Works Christian Family Church was founded in a modest flat in Fleurhof, Roodepoort, as a covenant partner of Christian Family Church Johannesburg. Initially, it started with only two members and expanded into a small waiting area at a local kindergarten.<br>

                        August 2019 – Growth
                        As attendance grew, the church moved into a classroom that could hold 40 people, and later expanded to two classrooms, each accommodating 80. With both classrooms consistently filled, the church introduced two services and began searching for a larger venue.

                        January 2020 – The Move
                        The church relocated to a new space in the Florida CBD, capable of serving up to 400 members. This move marked the launch of Greater Works Welfare, which provided food and clothing to local residents. Despite the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, the church remained committed to its mission.

                        September 2020 – Post-COVID Recovery
                        After the lockdown, the church reopened, but growth was limited by ongoing health risks. The church faced space challenges, particularly with parking and the children’s ministry, as more members returned.

                        October 2024 – The Second Move
                        The church moved to a larger facility in Roodepoort CBD, accommodating up to 500 members, with enhanced children's ministry facilities and ample parking. This location also serves as a hub for community initiatives, such as the monthly welfare events, soup kitchen, and essential giveaways.

                        Vision 2030 – The Future
                        Looking ahead, the church aims to acquire land at Westlake and Mainreef Road for its permanent home. This central location will better serve the communities of Fleurhof, Florida, Roodepoort, and beyond. The church is committed to fostering growth, partnering with schools, law enforcement, and public organizations to positively impact the community.

                        Our Mission
                        Our mission is to help people KNOW GOD, FIND FREEDOM, DISCOVER PURPOSE, and MAKE A DIFFERENCE through our weekend services, small groups, Growth Track, and service opportunities.
